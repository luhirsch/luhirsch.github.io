I am a Machine Learning PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Mike Davies](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-michael-e-davies), working on data driven sensing and imaging with a focus on methods that perform well in low-data scenarios.

Previously, I worked as an R&D Engineer at [Tenaris](https://www.tenaris.com/en) developing optical [non-destructive testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondestructive_testing) systems. Before that, I researched [photoacoustic tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoacoustic_imaging) and inverse problems at the [University of Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires).

Aside from research I enjoy hiking, solving crosswords and collecting random facts and slightly weird ideas.

Feel free to reach out to discuss research collaborations, ideas or anything that you think might interest me!
